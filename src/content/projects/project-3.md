### Project overview

- The main aim was to design the interface from scratch with clean look and feel, where user can  easily interact with each other by sending messages or files.
and is to make the user feel safe while using this platform, so I focused on designing it such that the users can easily navigate.
- The images shows the user's emotions  while using this chat application, it will show how much the person  is happy or sad or neutral based.
